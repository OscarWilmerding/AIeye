3d Printing
 - .2mm layer height
 - infill 10%
 - printed on an Ender 3 S1, any fdm printer could do it
 - printed out of PLA+
 - The ONLY part of all the parts that needs suports is the overhangs above the screen and button panel, I am using organic supports and am forcing the slicer to ONLY make supports in these areas with the painted support enforcer tool.
 - orientation is important, some of the parts are designed to only be printed one way, refer to the image below for the correct orientations:

Circuit Board
 - You are going to need to get a custom PCB fabricated, I prefer the service PCBway.
 - The first step is soldering the through hole components to the board, these are the components highlighted below
